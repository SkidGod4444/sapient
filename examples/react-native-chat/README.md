# SAPIENT Chat — React Native example (Expo)

Streaming chat UI over the [TypeScript SDK](../../sdks/typescript) with **two
transports**, toggled at runtime in the header:

- **on-device (default)** — the engine runs inside the app via
  [`@openhorizon/sapient-react-native`](../../sdks/react-native)
  (`sapient-ffi` → UniFFI → JSI TurboModule). GPU (wgpu→Metal/Vulkan) with
  automatic CPU fallback; model downloads land in the app's Caches.
- **server** — HTTP to `sapient serve` (the rung-0 dev loop from
  [`docs/MOBILE.md`](../../docs/MOBILE.md): inference stays off the phone
  while you iterate on UI; streaming via `expo/fetch`).

The `SapientClient` API is identical over both — the toggle swaps the
transport, nothing else.

```bash
# 1. Build the native RN library once (repo root; rebuilds after FFI changes)
cd sdks/react-native && npm install && \
  IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0 npm run ubrn:ios   # + ubrn:android for Android

# 2. This app — native code means a DEVELOPMENT BUILD (Expo Go can't run it)
cd examples/react-native-chat
npm install
npx expo prebuild -p ios          # generates ios/ (CNG — not committed)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx expo run:ios                  # or open ios/*.xcworkspace in Xcode
```

Server mode only (no native build needed — works in Expo Go):
`sapient serve` binds 0.0.0.0:11435. In the app, set **Base URL**:
- iOS simulator (same machine): `http://127.0.0.1:11435`
- Android emulator (same machine): `http://10.0.2.2:11435` — the emulator's
  alias for the host's loopback; `127.0.0.1` is the emulator itself
- Physical phone (Expo Go, same Wi-Fi): `http://<your-dev-machine-lan-ip>:11435`

Checks (no device needed): `npm run typecheck` and `npm run bundle:check`
(headless Metro bundle — CI runs both).

Integration notes baked into this example:
- `metro.config.js`: the SDK and the native package are `file:` deps outside
  the app root → both need `watchFolders` + the app's `node_modules` in
  `nodeModulesPaths`; AND the native package's own `node_modules/react-native`
  (newer, Flow `match` syntax) must be block-listed or Metro tries to parse it.
- The native package's `index.tsx` installs the Rust crate into Hermes at
  import time — importing it in Expo Go throws; keep server mode for Go.
- **Stop** aborts the stream, which cancels generation engine-side over both
  transports (HTTP reader cancel / `TokenListener` returning `false`).
- One model resident at a time on-device (phone RAM — MOBILE.md §5.2); the
  transport survives mode flips so the model stays warm.
