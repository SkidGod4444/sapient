# 🗺️ SAPIENT Roadmap — Huge Models on Small Devices

> **Mission:** run models that "shouldn't fit" on the hardware people actually own —
> laptops, Raspberry Pis, phones — with a one-line install and a great UX.
>
> The engine work below (quantization, mmap, SIMD, GPU offload) is the *price of entry*
> — llama.cpp already does it well. Our **moat** is the layer on top: pure-Rust
> portability, curated registry, modern CLI, and edge-specific automation
> (auto-pick quantization for available RAM, auto CPU/GPU offload, single static binary).

## Where we are (v0.3.7)
- ✅ **`MlxForwardEngine`** — native lazy-graph Metal forward pass for Llama/Qwen GGUF models. All activations stay on the GPU; one `eval()` per token; MLX fused SDPA. **~187 tok/s decode + 21 ms TTFT on Qwen2.5-0.5B Q4 (9.4× the CPU path); beats Ollama on 0.5B decode and has the lowest TTFT of any engine measured; within 1.3–1.5× of mlx-lm.** See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).
- ✅ RoPE-axis correctness fix (transpose to `[1, n_heads, seq, head_dim]` before `fast::rope`).
- ✅ **Engine reuse** — pipeline holds the engine in `Arc<Mutex<…>>`; streaming no longer rebuilds/re-quantizes the model per call (**TTFT 30–44× faster**, 1.5B: 3 s → 70 ms).
- ✅ Correct CPU + Metal inference for Phi & Llama/Qwen families (F16/BF16 safetensors + GGUF Q4/Q8).
- ✅ Curated registry, modern CLI (`chat`, `pull`, `run`, `models`, `serve`, `reset`, `rm`, `update`, `devices`), self-update. Distributed as prebuilt GitHub release binaries (not crates.io).
- ✅ GGUF Q4_0/Q8_0/K-quant loading with mmap support (models larger than RAM).
- ✅ Flash-Edge attention (online-softmax, O(head_dim) memory, NEON).
- ✅ Q8_0 KV cache (in-place, 4× RAM reduction vs F32, zero per-step allocation).
- ✅ Online F16→Q8_0 quantization at load time (near-lossless, ~1.06 bytes/weight).
- ✅ Native F16 GEMV and NEON Q4_K GEMV; adaptive rayon chunking.
- ✅ SDOT Q8_0 kernel (ARMv8.4A `sdot` via inline asm, runtime-detected, ~3% net gain — bandwidth-bound).
- ✅ Speculative decoding (`sapient chat --speculative`).
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible HTTP server (`sapient serve`) with lazy loading + **multi-model LRU cache** (top-N resident, byte-budgeted; instant switch-back vs Ollama's cold reload).
- ✅ Benchmark suite (`scripts/benchmark-compare.sh`, `scripts/gen-benchmark-report.py`).
- ✅ `sapient devices` — CPU/GPU detection, backend recommendations, hybrid Metal+CPU plan.
- ✅ Hybrid Metal+CPU layer-split inference for **both** LlamaForward and PhiForward.
- ✅ Phi-2 Metal crash fix — `mlx_sdpa_supported_head_dim()` gate prevents panic for unsupported head dims.
- ✅ Linux/Windows build fixes (cfg-gated `macos_gpu_name`, `dotprod` target_feature on SDOT functions).
- ✅ Chat UX: paste-safe `rustyline` line editor (bracketed paste — multi-line pastes no longer auto-submit) and **live Markdown rendering** of replies (`termimad` prose + `syntect`-highlighted code blocks; `--raw` / non-TTY falls back to plain text).
- ✅ GGUF correctness fixes for llama-family models, **verified end-to-end on CPU through Llama-3.2-1B / Llama-3.1-8B / DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (Q4_K_M)**:
  - **Q6_K dequant scale-indexing fix** (the big one): the old code used one scale per 32-group and only touched 8 of the 16 super-block scales, decoding every Q6_K tensor wrong → token-salad for any Q4_K_M model that stores its output/embedding as Q6_K (Llama-3.x, DeepSeek, Mistral). Catastrophic for tied-embedding models. Fixed in all three Q6_K decoders + regression test.
  - **q/k RoPE un-permute** for `llama`-arch GGUFs (ggml NORM-RoPE → HF/NEOX layout).
  - **tied-embedding fallback** (SmolLM2 / Llama-3.2 GGUFs load).
  - **Q8_0 W8A8 per-block activation quantization** (outlier-robust).
  - **KV-cache context cap** (`SAPIENT_CTX`, default 8192) so 128K-context 8B models no longer OOM-kill at load.
  - **Q4_K_M preferred over Q8_0** in GGUF file selection (smaller, fits 16 GB edge devices); **ungated tokenizer fallbacks** (`unsloth/*`, `deepseek-ai/*` instead of gated `meta-llama/*`).

## Guiding principles
1. **One PR/phase → one release.** Ship gradually; never a big-bang.
2. **Correctness is a gate.** Every phase adds/keeps a golden-output test (greedy decode of a known model → exact tokens). No release regresses output.
3. **Measure RAM and tok/s** every phase; numbers go in the release notes.
4. **CPU core first, accelerators second.** The quantized CPU engine is the shared foundation for *all four* targets.

---

## Phase 0 — Spike & de-risk  → `v0.1.x` ✅ DONE
Narrow proof before committing to the full build.
- ✅ Load one `Q4_0` GGUF, keep blocks quantized in memory (no F32 expansion).
- ✅ A single quantized `matmul_nt` (dequant-in-loop) for the linear layers only.
- ✅ Run a tiny model end-to-end; measure RAM (should ≈ file size) and tok/s.
- ✅ **Exit criteria met:** a Q4_0 linear path produces correct logits vs the F32 reference within tolerance.

## Phase 1 — Quantized CPU engine (foundation for every target)  → **`v0.2.0`** ✅ DONE
- ✅ `DType`: `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q4_K`, `Q5_0` storing raw quant blocks.
- ✅ Quantized `matmul_nt` / attention paths — never materialize F32 weights.
- ✅ GGUF loader; `from_gguf` wired into the Pipeline.
- ✅ mmap zero-copy: RAM ≈ file size.
- ✅ Auto-tokenizer fallback for GGUF repos.
- ✅ **Success metric met:** Q4_0/Q8_0 GGUF models run correctly in < 5 GB RAM.

## Phase 2 — CPU speed: SIMD + threading  → **`v0.2.x`** ✅ DONE (v0.2.9)
- ✅ SIMD quantized dot-products: **NEON** (Q4_0, Q8_0, Q4_K, native F16) + **AVX2** (x86).
- ✅ `rayon` threading; adaptive `gemv_chunk()` (4 tasks/core).
- ✅ `rayon::join` for parallel Q/K/V and gate/up projections.
- ✅ Flash-Edge attention (online-softmax, O(head_dim), NEON `vfmaq_f32`).
- ✅ Q8_0 KV cache (in-place, 4× RAM reduction, zero per-step allocation).
- ✅ Online F16→Q8_0 quantization at load time.
- ✅ Speculative decoding (`SpeculativePipeline`, auto draft selection).
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible `sapient serve` (lazy loading, `/v1/chat/completions`).
- ✅ **Success metric exceeded:** +89% (0.5B) and +138% (1.5B) tok/s vs v0.2.8 on M-series.

### Sprint 2b / Next CPU improvement (planned for v0.2.10)
SDOT integer arithmetic (ARMv8.4A — all M-series, Raspberry Pi 5):
- Replace i8→i16→i32→f32 widening (~10 NEON ops/8 weights) with `vdotq_s32` SDOT.
- Expected: ~4× compute improvement for Q8_0 dot products.
- Target: ~35–40 tok/s on 0.5B, ~18–20 tok/s on 1.5B.

## Phase 3 — Apple Silicon / Metal  → **`v0.3.0`–`v0.3.4`**
- ✅ Quantized matmul on MLX (`quantized_matmul`, group_size=64, 4-bit); unified memory.
- ✅ Native MLX attention + RoPE in `MlxForwardEngine` (no CPU fallback on the decode path).
- ✅ Auto CPU/GPU offload by model size & available memory (`use_mlx_engine` + hybrid split).
- ✅ **Decode throughput in the mlx-lm performance class** (187 tok/s @ 0.5B, beats Ollama).
- ✅ **Prefill / TTFT** — 21 ms @ 0.5B, 70 ms @ 1.5B (was 515 ms / 3 s). Root cause was the streaming path rebuilding the engine per call, not prefill compute (profiled at 64 ms). Fixed by reusing the loaded engine via `Arc<Mutex<…>>`.
- [ ] **Lower peak RAM** — store the token-embedding / `lm_head` table as MLX-Q4 and quantize weights without the transient F32 copy (currently ~1–1.5 GB vs mlx-lm's 0.3–1.0 GB).
- **Success metric:** a 7B–13B Q4 model interactive (> ~15 tok/s) on an M-series laptop.

## Phase 3b — Cross-platform GPU (Intel / AMD / Nvidia on Linux & Windows)  → **`v0.3.x`**
Bring GPU acceleration to the machines Metal can't reach, via a portable compute API
(`wgpu` → Vulkan / DX12 / Metal). The **same WGSL kernels** run on Intel Arc, AMD
Radeon, Nvidia, and Apple — and are dev-tested on Apple Silicon (Metal under wgpu).
- ✅ **Foundation** (`crates/sapient-backends/wgpu`): `WgpuContext` device acquisition
  (adapter-max limits past the 128 MiB binding cap, `SHADER_F16`, pipeline cache) +
  `matmul_nt_f32` / `matmul_nt_q8_0` kernels, validated on GPU against a host reference.
- ✅ **Resident kernels** (`resident.rs` + `shaders/*.wgsl`): GPU-resident `GpuBuffer`,
  RMSNorm, GEMV `matmul_nt`, RoPE (NEOX partial-rotary), SwiGLU, residual add, embedding
  gather, causal GQA **FlashDecoding attention** (online softmax, `kv_stride`), and a
  `copy_range` KV-cache append — each validated bit-close to a CPU reference.
- ✅ **`WgpuForwardEngine`** in `sapient-models` (`--features wgpu`): weights upload once
  (dequant→f32), GPU-resident KV cache, decode runs fully on-device, only logits read
  back. Wired into `ForwardEngine::Wgpu` + `LlmBackendKind::Wgpu` (`--backend wgpu`) for
  Llama/Qwen/Mistral (GGUF + safetensors). **Coherence proven**: logits match the CPU
  `LlamaForward` on a synthetic model (prompt + incremental decode, argmax + max_err<5e-3).
- [ ] **P5**: in-shader Q4_K/Q8_0 dequant (flat-u32 buffers, no f32 expansion at upload),
  f16 / quantized KV cache, kernel fusion (cut per-token dispatches), batched prefill
  (`seq_q>1`), discrete-adapter pick, `sapient devices` listing, Linux/Windows CI.
- **Success metric:** a Q4 model on an Intel Arc / AMD Radeon card decoding several×
  faster than that machine's CPU path, from the same single binary.

## Phase 4 — Raspberry Pi / small ARM SBC  → **`v0.3.x`** (partially done)
The hardest, most differentiating CPU target (2–8 GB RAM).
- ✅ Bigger-than-RAM support via mmap paging.
- ✅ `aarch64` validation; NEON SIMD applies to Pi 4/5.
- [ ] Low-RAM tuning: minimal activation buffers, optional `Q4_K_S`.
- [ ] Document Pi 4/5 setup and expected tok/s.
- **Success metric:** run a 3B Q4 model on a 4 GB Pi 5 without OOM.

## Phase 4b — Multi-model server  → **`v0.3.x`**
- [x] **Multi-model LRU residency** — keep the N most-recently-used models in memory (`--max-models`, default 3), switchable by the `model` field. Switch-back is a cache hit (no reload), ~5× faster than a cold load; beats Ollama's single-resident-model design.
- [x] **LRU eviction by count + RAM byte budget** (`--cache-gb`, default ~70% of system RAM).
- [x] **Streaming SSE** for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions`; cache lock not held during inference, so different models serve concurrently.
- [x] **Admission control** — bounded inference concurrency (`--max-concurrency`, tokio semaphore) so bursts queue instead of oversubscribing.
- [x] **Prefix/prompt caching** — reuse the KV cache for the longest shared token prefix (multi-turn chat / shared system prompts skip re-prefilling history); byte-identical output, verified. `ForwardEngine::truncate_cache` + `Pipeline::enable_prefix_cache`.
- [x] **Speculative decoding wired into `serve`** (`--speculative [--draft-model <alias>]`). `SpeculativePipeline` reuses loaded target+draft engines across requests (`Arc<Mutex<ForwardEngine>>`, no per-request rebuild), gained `*_with_config` + accessors, and is cached via `ServedModel`. Also fixed a pre-existing correctness bug: target verification now uses a cache-aware forward (`forward_all_logits_cached` + `truncate_cache` rollback) instead of resetting the KV cache — output was previously token-salad. Vocab-mismatch guard + family-aware auto-draft. See `docs/SERVING.md`.
- [ ] Continuous (in-flight) batching + parallel slots + chunked prefill; paged KV (block pool) — large single-sequence-engine rewrite, designed in `docs/SERVING.md`.
- [ ] OpenAI-compatible `logprobs`, `n` parameters.

Architecture + design for the deferred phases: **`docs/SERVING.md`** (built on the deep-research report — vLLM sleep mode, PagedAttention, mistral.rs as the pure-Rust precedent).

## Phase 5 — Phones (iOS / Android)  → **`v0.4.0`**
Most constrained, biggest "wow".
- Library packaging: stable C FFI / UniFFI bindings; static lib for mobile.
- Mobile mmap + thermal/throttle-aware scheduling.
- Sample iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin/JNI) apps.
- **Success metric:** a 1–3B Q4 model running on-device in a demo app.

---

## Phase 6 — On-device audio (STT → TTS → STS)  → **`v0.4.x`**
Cross-platform pure-Rust speech, the answer mlx-audio (Apple-only) and the
ONNX-wrapper crates (C++ dep) don't offer together.

- **6a — Whisper STT** ✅ DONE (CPU):
  - `sapient-audio` crate: decode/resample (`symphonia`+`rubato`) + Whisper log-mel
    front-end (`realfft`, slaney filterbank — numerically aligned to OpenAI/librosa).
  - `WhisperForward` engine + `AudioEngine` (encoder + decoder, growing self-attn KV
    cache, cross-attn K/V cached once per chunk) reusing `LlmBackendDispatch` for
    linear/layernorm/add. New kernels: `conv1d` (wraps `conv2d`), `gelu_erf` (exact
    erf GELU). Attention uses the CPU flash kernel with **explicit masks** (all-zeros
    for the non-causal encoder + cross-attn; causal for decoder self-attn).
  - `WhisperTokenizer` (control tokens + forced-prompt protocol + language detection),
    `TranscribePipeline`, `sapient transcribe <model> <audio>`, registry rows for
    `whisper-{tiny,base,small}`. Verified end-to-end on the JFK clip with `whisper-tiny`.
- **6b — GPU offload of the audio transformer body** ✅ DONE (`--features wgpu --backend wgpu`):
  - New WGSL kernels: `layer_norm` (with bias), exact-erf `gelu` (elementwise op=2),
    a broadcast `add_bias` (op=3), a `transpose_heads` (seq↔heads), and a `causal`
    flag on `attention` (non-causal for the encoder + cross-attn). All validated
    bit-close to CPU in `tests/resident.rs`.
  - `WhisperWgpuEngine` (`forward/whisper_wgpu.rs`) mirrors `WhisperForward` on the
    GPU: weights upload once as f32; encoder + decoder blocks (LayerNorm/matmul/
    attention/GELU/residual) run on-device; self-attn KV cache + cross-attn K/V are
    GPU-resident; only logits read back. mel/STFT/conv stay CPU (cheap, once/chunk).
  - `AudioEngine::WhisperWgpu` + `TranscribePipeline` wiring; verified end-to-end —
    `sapient transcribe whisper-tiny jfk.wav --backend wgpu` produces the identical
    transcript to CPU. Coherence test: `tests/whisper_wgpu_coherence.rs`.
  - **Perf note:** on small models / short clips the GPU path currently *trails* CPU
    (tiny 3.1 s vs 1.3 s, base 5.7 s vs 1.8 s end-to-end on M-series/Metal) — per-process
    GPU init + the one-token-at-a-time decoder with a logits read-back each step dominate
    the tiny GPU compute. CPU is the `transcribe` default. **Batched prefill** (encode the
    whole forced prompt in one pass) and keeping logits/argmax on-GPU are the optimizations
    that make the GPU win on larger models / longer audio (tracked under 6c).
- **6c — STT polish** (deferred): beam search, full `suppress_tokens`, timestamp
  tokens + long-audio re-seeking, streaming token output, `serve` integration.
- **6d — TTS** (deferred): Kokoro-82M (text encoder + vocoder/ISTFT; pure-Rust/MIT
  G2P to avoid GPLv3 espeak-ng). New kernels: transposed conv, ISTFT.
- **6e — STS** (deferred): cascade STT → existing LLM → TTS with `cpal` full-duplex
  mic/speaker + VAD; later, end-to-end speech-LLMs (Moshi/Mimi).
- **Success metric (6a):** `sapient transcribe whisper-base sample.wav` produces a
  correct transcript on CPU across macOS/Linux/Windows.

---

## Cross-cutting workstreams (continuous)
- **Correctness harness:** golden-token tests per architecture; CI gate.
- **Bench suite:** RAM + tok/s + time-to-first-token across targets; tracked over time.
- **UX automation:** `sapient` auto-selects a quantization that fits available RAM; `--mem` budget flag; clear "won't fit, try Q4" guidance.
- **Docs:** keep `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` and the README in sync each release.

## Definition of "leading the market"
Match llama.cpp on quantized edge inference (Phases 1–3), then win on:
**install in one line, run any curated model in one command, auto-fit the hardware, pure-Rust everywhere — including phones.**
