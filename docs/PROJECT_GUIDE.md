# 📚 The Big SAPIENT Guide

> A single, friendly tour of the whole project. We start *super* simple (imagine
> you're five), then go deeper, and finally walk through **every folder, every file,
> and every outside tool (dependency) we use** — and what each one is for.

---

## 1. What is SAPIENT? (the five-year-old version)

Imagine you have a very smart robot parrot. 🦜

- You **say something** to the parrot ("What color is the sky?").
- The parrot **thinks for a moment**.
- The parrot **says something back** ("The sky is blue!").

A computer program that can do this "talk back like it understands" trick is called a
**language model**. Famous big ones live on giant computers in the cloud. SAPIENT lets a
**small** version of that smart parrot live **right on your own laptop** — no internet
needed once it's downloaded, no giant cloud computer, no special graphics card required.

**SAPIENT is the machine that runs the parrot's brain on your computer.** That's it.

The fancy words for this are:
- **Edge inference engine** — "edge" means *your* device (not the cloud), "inference"
  means *running* an already-trained brain, and "engine" means *the thing that does the work*.
- **SLM** — "Small Language Model" — a parrot brain small enough to fit on a laptop.

SAPIENT is written in a programming language called **Rust** 🦀, which is loved for being
**fast** and **safe** (it rarely crashes).

## 1b. What's new in v0.2.9 (current release)

A lot changed between the first public release and today! Here is a quick summary before we
dive into the internals.

**Performance leap (Sprint 1–3 engine overhaul):**
- Flash-Edge attention: online-softmax tiled algorithm — O(head_dim) working memory, NEON `vfmaq_f32`.
- Q8_0 KV cache: in-place mutable updates via `Tensor::as_bytes_mut()` — 4× RAM reduction vs F32 for long contexts.
- Online quantization: F16/BF16 safetensors weights auto-quantized to Q8_0 at load time (no more F16→F32 expansion).
- Native F16 GEMV: decoded in NEON registers (`vcvt_f32_f16`), no intermediate F32 allocation.
- NEON Q4_K GEMV: nibble-unpacking + `vfmaq_f32` FMA.
- Zero-copy matmul outputs: `Tensor::from_f32_vec()` takes `Vec` ownership without copying.
- Adaptive rayon chunking: `gemv_chunk()` targets 4 tasks/core — avoids 151 936 micro-tasks for `lm_head`.
- Parallel Q/K/V and gate/up projections via `rayon::join` in `LlamaForward::forward_layer`.

**Measured results on Apple M-series (CPU, Q8_0 GGUF):**
| Model | Before | After | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-0.5B Q8_0 | 10 tok/s | 18.9 tok/s | +89% |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B Q8_0 | 4.2 tok/s | 10.0 tok/s | +138% |

**New features:**
- `sapient serve` — OpenAI-compatible HTTP server (`GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/completions`, `GET /v1/health`). Lazy loading on first request, plus a **multi-model LRU cache**: the N most-recently-used models stay resident (`--max-models`, default 3; byte budget via `--cache-gb`), so switching back to a recent model is instant — no cold reload like Ollama.
- `sapient chat --speculative [--draft-model <alias>]` — speculative decoding with auto-selected draft model.
- `sapient reset` / `sapient rm` — alias resolution fixed; now correctly resolves `openhorizon/*` aliases.
- ENOSPC auto-cleanup during `sapient pull` (disk-full guard).
- GitHub API rate-limit fallback in `sapient update`.

**Benchmark infrastructure:**
- `scripts/benchmark-compare.sh` — portable multi-engine benchmark (SAPIENT vs llama.cpp vs Ollama vs llamafile).
- `scripts/gen-benchmark-report.py` — generates `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` from JSON results.

---

## 2. How does the parrot actually "think"? (still pretty simple)

The parrot doesn't know words. It only knows **numbers**. So we play a translation game:

1. **Tokenizing** — We chop your sentence into little pieces called **tokens** (think:
   puzzle pieces — sometimes a whole word, sometimes part of a word) and give each piece a
   number. "Hello" might become the number `15496`.
2. **Embedding** — Each number is turned into a long list of numbers (a **vector**) that
   captures its "meaning." Similar words get similar lists.
3. **The layers (the thinking)** — These number-lists go through many **layers** of math.
   Each layer mixes the words together so the parrot understands how they relate ("sky"
   goes with "blue"). The two most important kinds of math here are:
   - **Attention** — every word gets to "look at" the other words and decide which ones
     matter. ("blue" pays attention to "sky".)
   - **A little neural network (MLP)** — squashes and stretches the numbers to find patterns.
4. **Predicting the next token** — After all the layers, the parrot produces a **score for
   every possible next token**. The highest score wins (or we roll dice weighted by the
   scores, to be creative). That winning token is the next piece of the answer.
5. **Repeat** — We add that new token to the sentence and do it all again to get the next
   word, and the next, until the parrot says "I'm done" (a special **end token**).

That loop — predict one token, add it, predict again — is how the whole answer gets written
one piece at a time. When you see words *streaming* onto your screen, that's this loop running.

### A few more words you'll meet
- **Tensor** — just a fancy word for "a box of numbers" (a list, a grid, or a cube of numbers).
- **Weights** — the millions of numbers the parrot *learned* during training. This is the
  "brain." We download these from Hugging Face. They never change while running.
- **KV cache** — a memory notebook 📒. Without it, the parrot would re-read the whole
  conversation for every new word (slow!). The cache lets it remember its earlier work so
  each new word is fast.
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)** — a trick to tell the parrot **where** each word is
  in the sentence (1st, 2nd, 3rd…), because order matters ("dog bites man" ≠ "man bites dog").
- **Quantization** — squishing the brain's numbers to be smaller (e.g. using tiny 4-bit
  numbers instead of big ones) so the model fits in less memory. SAPIENT can read these
  squished formats (GGUF Q4/Q5/Q8).

## 3. The journey of one chat message (the whole engine in one picture)

Here's what happens when you type `sapient chat openhorizon/phi-2` and say "Hi":

```
You type "Hi"
   │
   ▼
[sapient-cli]            The app you run in the terminal. Shows the pretty UI,
                         reads your message.
   │
   ▼
[sapient-hub]            "Do we have this model on disk? No? Download it from
                         Hugging Face." Saves the brain (weights) + tokenizer.
   │
   ▼
[sapient-tokenizers]     Wraps your message in a chat template and turns it into
                         token numbers.
   │
   ▼
[sapient-generate]       The conductor 🎼. Runs the predict-one-token loop, decides
                         which token to pick, streams text back, knows when to stop.
   │
   ▼
[sapient-models]         The actual parrot brain logic: run the layers (attention +
                         MLP) for Phi or Llama-style models, using the weights.
   │
   ▼
[sapient-backends-cpu]   The number-crunching muscles 💪. Does the heavy math
                         (matrix multiply, attention, RoPE, normalization) fast.
   │
   ▼
Tokens come back → turned into text → streamed to your screen as "Hi there!"
```

`sapient-core` is the shared toolbox used by *everyone* above (it defines what a "tensor"
is). `sapient-telemetry` quietly measures speed. `sapient-ir`, `sapient-io`,
`sapient-runtime`, and `sapient-scheduler` power the lower-level "graph" mode (for running
ONNX/GGUF computation graphs and a raw inference server).

---

## 4. The crates (folders of code), one by one

SAPIENT is split into small libraries called **crates** (Rust's word for a package). Each
crate has one job. Splitting things up keeps each part easy to understand and test.

Below, for each crate, you get: **what it's for**, then **every file inside it**.

### 🧱 `sapient-core` — the shared toolbox
The most basic building blocks every other crate uses. If SAPIENT were LEGO, this is the
box of basic bricks.
- `lib.rs` — the front door: lists what this crate shares with others.
- `tensor.rs` — defines the **Tensor** (the "box of numbers"). Shapes, data types, slicing,
  reshaping, and converting half-precision (F16/BF16) numbers to full F32. The heart of the toolbox.
- `buffer.rs` — the raw block of memory a tensor's numbers actually live in (kept aligned so
  the CPU can read it quickly).
- `dtype.rs` — the list of number **types** we support: F32 (big/accurate), F16 & BF16
  (half-size), and integers. Knows how many bytes each takes.
- `shape.rs` — describes a tensor's **shape** (e.g. "3 rows × 4 columns") and the math to
  walk through it (strides).
- `error.rs` — the shared list of things that can go wrong (e.g. "shapes don't match"), so
  errors read nicely everywhere.

### 🔌 `sapient-ir` — the computation graph (advanced mode)
Describes a model as a **graph** of math operations (like a flowchart: this op feeds into
that op). Used by the ONNX/GGUF "graph" path, not the main chat path.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `op.rs` — the catalog of operations (Add, MatMul, Softmax, …).
- `node.rs` — one box in the flowchart (an op plus its inputs/outputs).
- `graph.rs` — the whole flowchart and how to build/connect it.
- `shape_inference.rs` — figures out the shape of each tensor as data flows through, before
  running anything.
- `passes/` — automatic **optimizers** that rewrite the graph to be faster:
  - `passes/mod.rs` — lists the passes.
  - `passes/constant_folding.rs` — pre-computes parts that never change.
  - `passes/dead_code.rs` — deletes ops whose results nobody uses.
  - `passes/fusion.rs` — merges several small ops into one bigger, faster op.
  - `passes/layout.rs` — arranges data in memory for faster access.

### 💾 `sapient-io` — reading model files from disk
Knows how to open the file formats that store model brains.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `safetensors.rs` — reads **Safetensors** files (the main, modern weight format; safe & fast).
- `gguf.rs` — reads **GGUF** files, including **dequantizing** squished Q4/Q5/Q8 numbers back
  into normal numbers.
- `onnx.rs` — reads **ONNX** model graphs (a cross-tool standard format).

### 🔤 `sapient-tokenizers` — words ↔ numbers
Turns text into tokens and back, and formats chat conversations.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `tokenizer.rs` — wraps Hugging Face's tokenizer; finds the special **start/end tokens**
  (including *all* end tokens a model uses, like `<|im_end|>`) so generation stops correctly.
- `chat.rs` — applies **chat templates** (the Jinja2 recipe that wraps your message with
  role markers like `<|im_start|>user`). Has built-in templates for ChatML, Llama, Gemma, etc.

### 🌐 `sapient-hub` — downloading & managing models
Talks to Hugging Face, downloads model files, caches them, and keeps the **registry** of
which models SAPIENT supports.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `registry.rs` — the **curated list** of supported models. Maps friendly `openhorizon/…`
  aliases to real Hugging Face repos (e.g. `openhorizon/phi-2` → `microsoft/phi-2`).
- `client.rs` — the high-level "download this model" client.
- `download.rs` — the fast downloader (parallel chunks); reads the `SAPIENT_HUB_*` env vars.
- `cache.rs` — where downloaded files are stored on your disk.
- `resolver.rs` — figures out *which* files a model needs (config, tokenizer, weight shards).
- `model_info.rs` — reads a model's `config.json` into a tidy `ModelInfo` (layers, heads,
  RoPE settings, `partial_rotary_factor`, etc.).
- `gguf.rs` — hub-side helpers for GGUF repositories.

### 🧠 `sapient-models` — the parrot brain logic
The real generation math: how to run a Phi or Llama-style model layer by layer.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `weights.rs` — loads weight tensors from Safetensors and finds them by name (handles
  prefixes, biases, and tied embeddings).
- `gguf_weights.rs` — maps GGUF tensor names to the names the engine expects, and
  **un-permutes the q/k attention weights** for `llama`-arch GGUFs (llama.cpp stores
  them in ggml's NORM-RoPE row order; SAPIENT uses HF/NEOX RoPE, so without this they
  produce garbage). Qwen2/Gemma GGUFs use NEOX RoPE and are left untouched. Also handles
  tied-embedding models (no `output.weight` → reuse the token-embedding matrix).
- `registry.rs` — builds an IR graph for a model type (graph mode).
- `forward/` — the **forward pass** (running the model to get an answer):
  - `forward/mod.rs` — picks the right engine for a model type.
  - `forward/common.rs` — shared building blocks: embedding lookup, **linear layers**
    (`matmul_nt`), normalization, RoPE (full + partial), attention, bias-add.
  - `forward/backend.rs` — the backend interface (CPU vs Metal) and the default helpers
    like "linear with bias" and "partial RoPE."
  - `forward/llama.rs` — the **Llama engine** (also runs Qwen2.5, SmolLM2, TinyLlama,
    Mistral): RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU MLP, optional Q/K/V biases for Qwen.
  - `forward/phi.rs` — the **Phi engine**: LayerNorm with biases, partial RoPE, parallel
    attention+MLP block, and the `<final_layernorm>` + `lm_head` bias.
  - `forward/mlx_engine.rs` — the **native Metal engine** (`MlxForwardEngine`, Apple
    Silicon + `--features mlx`). Runs the whole Llama/Qwen forward pass as one MLX
    lazy graph — every activation stays on the GPU, `eval()` runs once per token.
    Auto-selected for GGUF Llama/Qwen models when the Metal backend is active.
    ~168 tok/s on Qwen2.5-0.5B Q4 (8.6× the CPU path). See `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- `architectures/` — graph **builders** for many model types (used by the IR/graph path).
  Note: only Phi and Llama are wired into live chat today; the rest are scaffolding.
  - `llama.rs`, `phi.rs`, `qwen.rs`, `gemma.rs`, `gpt2.rs`, `bert.rs`, `mixtral.rs`, `mod.rs`.

### 🎼 `sapient-generate` — the conductor
Ties everything together into the simple `Pipeline` you call. Runs the token loop, picks
tokens, streams text, and stops at the right time.
- `lib.rs` — front door; exposes `GenerationConfig` and `SamplingStrategy`.
- `pipeline.rs` — the `Pipeline`: load a model, `generate`, `chat`, `generate_stream`,
  `embed`. Handles chat templates, stop sequences, and **multi-EOS** stopping.
- `speculative.rs` — `SpeculativePipeline`: wraps a draft + target `Pipeline`; draft generates
  candidates, target verifies via `forward_all_logits` in a single batched forward pass.
  Auto-selects a smaller registry model as the draft when `--draft-model` is omitted.
- `sampler.rs` — **how to pick the next token**: greedy (highest score), temperature,
  top-k, top-p, and repetition penalty.
- `kv_cache.rs` — the memory notebook (KV cache) helpers. As of v0.2.9 the cache is allocated
  as Q8_0 blocks (4× RAM reduction vs F32) and updated in-place via `Tensor::as_bytes_mut()`
  with zero per-step allocation.

### 🗓️ `sapient-scheduler` — running many requests (server mode)
Batches and schedules inference requests so a server can handle several at once.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `request.rs` — one inference request (with priority/deadline fields).
- `batcher.rs` — groups multiple requests into one batch.
- `scheduler.rs` — decides what runs when.
- `executor.rs` — actually runs the batches.

### ⚙️ `sapient-runtime` — the graph runtime
Runs an IR graph end-to-end with a session object (the engine behind `sapient serve`).
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `model.rs` — loads a model graph + its weights.
- `session.rs` — `InferenceSession`: feed inputs, get outputs, with timing.

### 📊 `sapient-telemetry` — measuring speed & health
Optional metrics, tracing, and profiling so you can see how fast things run.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `telemetry.rs` — sets up logging/tracing.
- `metrics.rs` — counters and histograms (e.g. tokens/sec).
- `profiler.rs` — simple timers for sections of code.

### 💪 `sapient-backends-cpu` — the CPU number-crunching muscles
The fast math that runs on any CPU. This is where most of the real work happens during chat.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `backend.rs` — dispatches each operation to the right kernel.
- `pool.rs` — reuses memory buffers so we don't constantly allocate/free (faster).
- `kernels/` — the individual math routines ("kernels"):
  - `kernels/mod.rs` — lists the kernels.
  - `kernels/matmul.rs` — **matrix multiply** + `matmul_nt` (the linear-layer core) + `gemm`.
  - `kernels/attention.rs` — **attention** + grouped-query attention + causal masking.
  - `kernels/rope.rs` — **RoPE** position trick (full and partial/Phi versions).
  - `kernels/softmax.rs` — turns scores into probabilities (stable version).
  - `kernels/layernorm.rs` — **LayerNorm** and **RMSNorm** (keep numbers well-behaved).
  - `kernels/reduce.rs` — sums/means/maxes across a dimension.
  - `kernels/elementwise.rs` — add/multiply/etc. and activations (GELU, SiLU…).
  - `kernels/conv2d.rs` — 2D convolution (for vision-style ops).

### 🍎 `sapient-backends-metal` — Apple Silicon GPU
The hook for running on a Mac's GPU via Apple's **MLX**. Enabled when built with
`--features mlx`; otherwise the engine falls back to the CPU kernels.
- `lib.rs` — front door.
- `backend.rs` — Metal/MLX backend detection and integration point.

### 🖥️ `sapient-cli` — the app you actually run
The `sapient` command-line program: parses commands, shows the modern UI, and calls the
libraries above.
- `main.rs` — defines all commands (`chat`, `pull`, `run`, `list`, `models`, `info`,
  `serve`, `login`, `update`, `reset`, `rm`, …) and wires them up. The interactive chat
  REPL reads input with a `rustyline` line editor (`read_chat_line`) so pasting multi-line
  text no longer auto-submits — bracketed-paste mode inserts the paste into the buffer and
  only a real Enter sends it.
- `markdown.rs` — **live Markdown rendering** of streamed replies (`StreamRenderer`):
  prose/headings/lists/tables via `termimad`, fenced code blocks via `syntect` syntax
  highlighting. It commits completed Markdown blocks permanently and repaints only the
  trailing in-progress block in place, so formatting appears as the model streams without
  thrashing the screen. Falls back to raw passthrough for pipes / `NO_COLOR` / `--raw`.
- `ui.rs` — the **modern terminal UI**: banner, colored role "chip" badges, spinners,
  tables, success/error messages, and the tokens/sec stat line.
- `hub.rs` — CLI-side model management (list cached, remove, login, resolve paths).
  `reset` and `rm` now correctly resolve `openhorizon/*` aliases before deleting.
- `progress.rs` — the live download progress bar; includes ENOSPC auto-cleanup on disk-full.
- `server.rs` — the **OpenAI-compatible HTTP server** (`GET /v1/models`,
  `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/completions`, `GET /v1/health`). No model is loaded
  at startup; the first API request triggers download + load (Ollama-style lazy loading).
  Supports `--speculative` flag for chat completions.
- `update.rs` — `sapient update`: self-updates the binary from GitHub releases, with
  GitHub API rate-limit fallback.

## 5. Every dependency (outside tool) and what it does

We don't build everything from scratch — we stand on great open-source libraries. Here's

## 6. How to build and run it yourself

```bash
# 1) Get the code
git clone https://github.com/SkidGod4444/sapient
cd sapient

# 2) Build the app (CPU version — works everywhere)
cargo build --release -p sapient-cli
# the program is now at ./target/release/sapient

# 3) See which models are supported
./target/release/sapient models

# 4) Chat! (downloads the model the first time)
./target/release/sapient chat openhorizon/phi-2

# Apple Silicon GPU build (optional, macOS only):
cargo build --release -p sapient-cli --features mlx
```

Useful chat commands while chatting: `/help`, `/clear` (forget the conversation), `/exit`.

## 7. How the pieces depend on each other (the map)

```
sapient-cli  ──────────────► everything (it's the app)
   │
   ├── sapient-generate  ─► sapient-models, sapient-tokenizers, sapient-hub,
   │                        sapient-runtime, sapient-io, sapient-backends-cpu
   │
   ├── sapient-models    ─► sapient-hub, sapient-io, sapient-ir, sapient-backends-cpu
   ├── sapient-runtime   ─► sapient-scheduler, sapient-io, sapient-telemetry, sapient-ir
   ├── sapient-scheduler ─► sapient-ir, sapient-backends-cpu
   ├── sapient-backends-cpu ─► sapient-ir
   ├── sapient-ir / sapient-io / sapient-tokenizers / sapient-hub ─► sapient-core
   └── sapient-core      ─► (nobody — it's the foundation)
```

Read it top-down: the app uses the conductor, the conductor uses the brain and the
muscles, and everyone shares the basic toolbox at the bottom.

## 8. Glossary (quick reference)

- **Token** — a small chunk of text (word or word-part) the model reads as a number.
- **Tensor** — a box of numbers (list / grid / cube).
- **Weights** — the model's learned numbers (its "brain"). Downloaded, never changed at runtime.
- **Forward pass** — running the model once to get the next-token scores.
- **Attention** — the step where words "look at" each other to understand context.
- **MLP / SwiGLU / GELU / SiLU** — small math networks/activations inside each layer.
- **LayerNorm / RMSNorm** — keep the numbers from getting too big or too small.
- **RoPE** — tells the model the position of each token.
- **KV cache** — a memory of past work so each new token is fast.
- **Logits** — the raw scores for every possible next token (before picking one).
- **Sampling** — how we choose the next token from the scores (greedy, top-k, top-p…).
- **EOS** — "end of sequence" token: the model's way of saying "I'm done."
- **Quantization** — storing weights with fewer bits to save memory (GGUF Q4/Q5/Q8).
- **Backend** — where the math runs: CPU (everywhere) or Metal/MLX (Mac GPU).
- **Crate** — a Rust package/library.
- **IR (Intermediate Representation)** — a flowchart of math ops used by the graph runtime.

## 9. Performance guide — how to get fast inference

### Recommended: GGUF quantized models

For **CPU inference** on any platform (Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.), always use a GGUF
quantized model rather than F16 safetensors:

| Model | Format | RAM needed | Typical tok/s (Apple M-series, CPU) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openhorizon/qwen2.5-0.5b-q4` | GGUF Q8_0 | ~640 MB | ~18–19 tok/s |
| `openhorizon/qwen2.5-1.5b-q4` | GGUF Q8_0 | ~1.6 GB | ~10 tok/s |
| `openhorizon/phi-2-q4` | GGUF Q8_0 | ~2.8 GB | ~5 tok/s |
| `openhorizon/phi-2` | F16 safetensors | ~2.7 GB | ~2–3 tok/s |

As of v0.2.9, F16 safetensors weights are **auto-quantized to Q8_0 at load time** (online
quantization), eliminating the F16→F32 conversion overhead on every token. GGUF Q4/Q8 still
wins on RAM because the quantized blocks stay compressed in memory and dequantize one
32-element block at a time inside the dot product (4–8× lower memory bandwidth vs F32).

### Apple Silicon: Metal GPU

Build with `--features mlx` to enable the Metal GPU backend. MLX uses Apple Silicon's
unified memory — there's no CPU↔GPU copy overhead. The engine picks Metal automatically
when the model fits in memory (`sapient backend-info` shows the capacity).

Key changes shipped across phases:
- **Phase 2**: rayon parallel dot products across output rows + NEON SIMD (Q4_0, Q8_0).
- **Phase 3**: MLX persistent weight cache (upload each weight to GPU once, reuse per token),
  GQA fallback to CPU attention, auto backend selection by available unified memory.
- **Phase 4** (v0.2.3): memory-mapped GGUF loading — run models larger than your RAM.
- **v0.2.6**: Native K-quant inference (Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K dequant on-the-fly, no F32 expansion).
- **v0.2.9**: Flash-Edge attention (online-softmax, O(head_dim) memory), Q8_0 KV cache (in-place,
  4× RAM reduction), online F16→Q8_0 quantization at load time, native F16/Q4_K NEON GEMV,
  adaptive rayon chunking, speculative decoding, OpenAI-compatible `sapient serve`.

### Phase 4: Memory-mapped GGUF (bigger-than-RAM models, Raspberry Pi)

SAPIENT v0.2.3 adds `memmap2`-backed tensor loading for GGUF files. Instead of reading
the whole file into heap memory, the engine maps it into virtual address space and lets the
OS page in weight blocks on demand. Only the transformer layers being computed right now
need to be in physical RAM.

**What this means in practice:**
- A 4 GB Q4_K_M model on a device with 2 GB RAM — no OOM, just slower token throughput
  because of page faults when the OS swaps layers in.
- Peak RAM during load drops from `file_size + F32_size` to just the active layer footprint
  (~30–200 MB depending on the model).
- Q4_0/Q8_0 tensors: **zero copy** — the tensor points directly into the mmap'd file region.
- K-quants / F16 / BF16: dequantized to F32 at load time (the raw bytes still come from
  the mmap, so no heap copy of the raw file during load).

**How to use it:**

```bash
# Auto: mmap activates when GGUF file > 80% of available RAM
sapient chat openhorizon/qwen2.5-1.5b-q4

# Forced: always use mmap (useful on constrained devices like Raspberry Pi)
sapient chat --mmap openhorizon/qwen2.5-1.5b-q4

# Also fixed in v0.2.3: double-load bug
# Previously, the pipeline loaded tensors twice (once for metadata, once for forward engine).
# Now it uses GgufLoader::parse_metadata_only() for the header step — one load only.
```

**Raspberry Pi and ARM SBCs:**

RPi 4 (4 GB) and RPi 5 (8 GB) run aarch64 Linux, so the NEON SIMD kernels apply.
SAPIENT's Q8_0 and Q4_0 dot products use `vld1q_u8`/`vfmaq_f32` intrinsics — the same
fast path as Apple M-series chips. Expected throughput:

| Device | Model | Mode | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| RPi 5 (8 GB) | qwen2.5-0.5b-q4 | heap | ~3–5 tok/s |
| RPi 5 (8 GB) | qwen2.5-1.5b-q4 | mmap | ~1–2 tok/s |
| RPi 4 (4 GB) | smollm2-360m-q4 | heap | ~5–8 tok/s |

(Measured numbers are estimates — actual performance depends on SD card speed for mmap paging.)

### Linux / NVIDIA (DGX, cloud)

CUDA is not yet supported. Until it is, use GGUF Q4/Q8 models on CPU — they run the
rayon + NEON parallel kernels and are the fastest CPU path. The DGX Spark (ARM64 Grace)
also has NEON, so the Q8_0 path gets the full SIMD benefit.

### Benchmarking (SAPIENT vs Ollama)

SAPIENT ships a dedicated LLM benchmark command:

```bash
# Human-readable table
sapient bench-llm openhorizon/qwen2.5-0.5b-q4 \
    --prompt "Explain quantum entanglement in one sentence." \
    --max-tokens 50 --runs 3 --mmap

# Machine-readable JSON (for scripted comparisons)
sapient bench-llm openhorizon/qwen2.5-0.5b-q4 --json > results.json
```

Metrics reported: model load time, time-to-first-token (TTFT), decode tok/s, peak RSS.

Full Ollama comparison (requires `ollama serve` running):

```bash
bash scripts/benchmark.sh --model 0.5b --runs 3 --out results/
python3 scripts/gen-benchmark-report.py \
    --sapient results/sapient_result.json \
    --ollama  results/ollama_result.json \
    --out docs/BENCHMARKS.md
```

See `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` for methodology, reproducibility instructions, and a full side-by-side
comparison table. The short story: SAPIENT wins on TTFT, peak RAM, binary size, and cold-start
latency; Ollama wins on sustained tok/s for larger models (acknowledged openly in the report).

*Happy hacking! If anything here ever stops matching the code, the code wins — please open
a PR to fix the docs.* 🦜
